IN PROGRESS
===========
- Could trk be a MIDI recorder/player? Would require: 
    - Display CC/PC "properly" (maybe on the right side instead of top)
    - Add filter for input and output (maybe as a proxy config: allow, deny, allow all, deny all, etc.)
    - Add redirect with filter (DT->DN, real time+mute only by eg.)
-> See http://www.midish.org/

BUG
===
- New recorded events are not sent to the player state.
    - Step 1 : Record unmute chann 1
    - Step 2 : Record mute chann 1
    - Move back to step 1 BUG chann 1 is still muted
- Erase does not send events.
    - Step 1 : Record mute chann 1
    - Erase step 1 BUG chann 1 is still muted
- Always keep the state of the devices, even when not recording.
    - Change to pattern 2
    - Start recording BUG Sequence is not on pattern 2 and the device won't send pattern 2 because it is already activated.

IMPROVEMENTS
============
- Continous recording. Having to restart recording after each move is tiresome. Pause recording while playing is safe (but keep the recording state?).
- Use all of the screen for the UI. Option window could be on the right with full height (would ease browsing MIDI ports).
- Record while playing.

UNSORTED
========
- Page with different length (each page would be a part) and step per bar (1 to 16).
- Fade out FX
- Play all events when start recording (because we may have forgotten to record before changing the machine state)
    -> Would be better to keep recording.
- Stop stops the recording. Why?
- Send stop to all when moving around? Otherwise, a paused digitone would delay chaning pattern and mute.
- Full screen UI
- [Refactoring] Row -> Step // no more row but tick and step would be cool
- [Refactoring] Device model or template (ie. DT vs DN to format display and configure).
- Temp file saved and restored automatically. Ctrl+S to save explicitely. Ctrl+L or R to reload from disk (with confirmation).
- Add pattern length + global scale + bank scale + pattern scale.
- Song part? Could be bank + 16 patterns with bank length. Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn to change bank. Have an "original" mode with 8 banks of 16 patterns and an extended mode of 25 banks of 99 patterns.
- Ctrl+Z
- Display help
- Allow bigger/smaller page (even 12 or 20 by eg. - between 1 and 64 steps by eg.), group by 16 anyway.
