IN PROGRESS
===========
- ! Improve play (only send message for changes from the actual current state of the player)

NEXT
====
+ Bug
- Should not be able to clear first step. Or should be able to undo (delete again or Ctrl+Z).
- Recording events on a step should be kept event if the event is the same as the previous *at the time of the recording*.
    -> This is now a display issue (the data is properly saved to the track)
- Multiple track with the same channel? See TrackOf().

+ Improvements
- Cache the steps (invalidate on update, be careful with consolidated step)
- Center dialog
- Do not select label in dialog

+ Features
- Temp file saved and restored automatically. Ctrl+S to save explicitely. Ctrl+L or R to reload from disk (with confirmation).
- Add pattern length + global scale + bank scale + pattern scale.
- Song part? Could be bank + 16 patterns with bank length. Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn to change bank. Have an "original" mode with 8 banks of 16 patterns and an extended mode of 25 banks of 99 patterns.
- Ctrl+Z
- Display help
- Allow bigger/smaller page (even 12 or 20 by eg. - between 1 and 64 steps by eg.), group by 16 anyway.

+ Refactoring
- Row -> Step // no more row but tick and step would be cool
- Review (m *Model) Pattern() int -> Rename to Page() remove useless methods if any?
- Device model or template (ie. DT vs DN to format display and configure).
