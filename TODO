In progress
===========
- Fix MIDI error, run render() in its own goroutine.

Refactoring
===========
- Row -> Step // no more row but tick and step would be cool
- Device model or template (ie. DT vs DN to format display and configure).

Features
========
- Temp file saved and restored automatically. Ctrl+S to save explicitely. Ctrl+L or R to reload from disk (with confirmation).
- Add pattern length + global scale + bank scale + pattern scale.
- Song part? Could be bank + 16 patterns with bank length. Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn to change bank. Have an "original" mode with 8 banks of 16 patterns and an extended mode of 25 banks of 99 patterns.
- Ctrl+Z
- Display help
- Allow bigger/smaller page (even 12 or 20 by eg. - between 1 and 64 steps by eg.), group by 16 anyway.
