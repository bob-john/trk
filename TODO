IN PROGRESS
===========
- Checkbox group (for input/output)
- Write/load settings from file :-)

- Fix Back should restore selectedItem - this will be fixed with the refactoring (if the ListView instance handles the selectedItem!)

- Refactor:
    - menuItem -> View interface
    - Settings -> ListView
    - Up/Down should be handled in ListView, not in Dialog (Dialog is only a container for a stack of views)
    - etc.

- Let configure the devices ports, have multiple names (because of the system), maybe have a global configuration?
    trk devices -- list all the devices on the system
    trk devices <path> -- list all the devices in the file
    trk devices add <path> digitakt|digitone [<input-port> <output-port>] <channels> -- could guess from the port name
    -- add some devices.json to the .trk file.
