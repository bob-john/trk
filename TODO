IN PROGRESS
===========
- ? Fix recording (mute & pattern) -> see Part1
- ! Improve play (only send message for changes from the actual current state of the player)
- Be careful with changes: recording events on a step should be kept event if the event is the same as the previous *at the time of the recording*.

NEXT
====
+ Bug
- Should not be able to clear first step. Or should be able to undo (delete again or Ctrl+Z).

+ Improvements
- Center dialog
- Do not select label in dialog

+ Features
- Temp file saved and restored automatically. Ctrl+S to save explicitely. Ctrl+L or R to reload from disk (with confirmation).
- Add pattern length + global scale + bank scale + pattern scale.
- Song part? Could be bank + 16 patterns with bank length. Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn to change bank. Have an "original" mode with 8 banks of 16 patterns and an extended mode of 25 banks of 99 patterns.
- Ctrl+Z
- Display help

+ Refactoring
- BoltDB?
- Row -> Step
- map[int]Row{[]Part} -> []Part{map[int]Step}
- DeviceSettings{map[string]struct{}} -> DeviceSettings{[]string}
- Drop DeviceSource, use device names.
- Device model or template (ie. DT vs DN to format display and configure).
