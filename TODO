- Remove line mode for the pen, cell mode only (ie. see KeyEnter).
- Backspace should clear the cell.
- Delete should remove the line.

- Play the line when playing.
- Play the line when moving the pen (this is tricky: consolidate the changes when going up!).
- Play the cell on commit or input when appropriate (commit for pattern, input for mute, len is not concerned).
