IN PROGRESS
===========
- Music API. See http://sonic-pi.net/.

NEXT
====
- Save selected port to configuration file (associate to device name). Do not prompt again if the port is available.
- Do not require caller to handle errors. Panic.
- Encapsulate *UI into *Tracker.
- Do not require tracker.New(). Use package method.
- Do not require ui.Close()? Close termbox after each UI interaction?
- Send pattern change/mute to another device. By eg. mute from Digitone to Digitakt. Copy? Shadow?
