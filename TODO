TODO
====
- Let configure the devices ports, have multiple names (because of the system), maybe have a global configuration?
    trk devices -- list all the devices on the system
    trk devices <path> -- list all the devices in the file
    trk devices add <path> digitakt|digitone [<input-port> <output-port>] <channels> -- could guess from the port name
    -- add some devices.json to the .trk file.
