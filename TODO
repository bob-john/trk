+ Bug
- Should not be able to clear first step
- Moving around with keyboard is fiddly

+ Features
- Add pattern length+scale like on the digitakt, keep the data per actual pattern (PC) - that would require two parameters (one per machine).
    - Or just global scale? Or nothing for now.
    - Or add a second device in the UI?
- Song part?
- Display help

+ Format .trk
- Add a definition file (channels, device name, port - to know whether to merge message send and receive, typically mutes)
